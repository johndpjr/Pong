In Pong, a player controls a paddle that can be moved up and down with the up and down arrow keys, respectively.
The player must move the paddle to hit the ball that is moving. The object of the game is to be the first player to reach 11 points.
The player loses a point when he/she fails to return the ball to the other paddle.
